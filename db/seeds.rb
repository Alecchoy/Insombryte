# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# Event.create!(title: "coachella 20222", description: "top of the line event", location: "socal", category: "festival", start_date: start_date, end_date: start_date, start_time: '19:00:00' , end_time: '19:00:00', host_id: 1 )
